## 1. Two Sum
We have list with integers and target(list).
With the help of this function, it is possible to determine which sum of the numbers in the list is the target.
How this method works:
The twoSum method iterates over the list nums to find two indices, i and j, such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target.
