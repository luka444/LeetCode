# LeetCode

## 1. Two Sum
We have list with integers and target(list).
With the help of this function, it is possible to determine which sum of the numbers in the list is the target.
How this method works:
The twoSum method iterates over the list nums to find two indices, i and j, such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target.

## 2. Palindrome Number
we have an integer.
With the help of this function, it is possible to determine wich number is palindrome number.
Explanation of a palindrome: integer is palindrome, when it reads same forward and backward, for example:
100 is not a palindrome, because from right to left it is: 001, but 202 is a palindrome, because from right to left
it is: 202.

## 3. Roman to integer
we have a string of roman numbers.
with the help of this function, it is possible to convert the Roman numeral to its integer equivalent.
The function evaluates each character in the string, checks if the current numeral is smaller than the next, and accordingly adds or subtracts the values to get the final integer representation.
